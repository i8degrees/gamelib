  VideoMode Class Usage Example

  // Public headers interface; this includes all of nomlib's header files for
  // the graphics subsystem supported by your platform.
  #include <nomlib/graphics.hpp>

  // ...or just the header file we need here, if you the minimal route!
  #include <nomlib/graphics/VideoMode.hpp>

  nom::Display context; // Primary video surface

  // This should be safe to call before the initialization of the video display;
  // setting of the video resolution beforehand is not necessary.
  nom::VideoModeList modes = context.getVideoModes();

  // Output to the console the available modes we have
  for ( nom::uint32 idx = 0; idx != modes.size(); idx++ )
  {
    modes[idx].pp();
