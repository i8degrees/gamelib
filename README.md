### Dependencies ###

* cmake v2.6+
* SDL v1.2.15
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf

### OSX ###

After installing the necessary dependencies listed above -- either through brew
or perhaps hunting down each individual dependency Framework:

```
  git clone https://github.com/i8degrees/nomlib
  cd nomlib
  mkdir build && cd build`
```

* Dynamic library installed under default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (/usr or /usr/local):

```
  cmake ..
  make
  make install
```

* Framework bundle:

```
  cmake -DBUILD_FRAMEWORK=on ..
  make
  make install && cp -av nomlib.framework $HOME/Library/Frameworks/.
```

Uninstall support is provided by running 'make uninstall' within the build directory.

### Linux ###

* Until I get around to writing proper instructions, you may take a look at my
.travis.yml build script in the root of this repository.
