# TODO

* Use C++ templates for Coords class

* Finish Update logic in BitmapFont class so that we can make it an official
Drawables type.

* Implement a NULL GameState class?
* Use exceptions library in C++
* Use Uint32, etc. definitions
* const types

* Test alpha values within color class with graphics engine; experimental support
is there

* joystick buttons demo
* Homebrew Formula?

## Completed

* Finish Update logic in SDL_Gradient so that we can make it an official
Drawables type; we can then also make SDL_MessageBox an official Drawables as
well -- const issues prevent us from doing so at the moment.

* Fix nom::Line memory leak (update variable is merely a temporary partial stopgap)
* nomlib_examples submodule repo and makefile setup
* Makefile Dependencies
* Add SDL_EnableKeyRepeat() into SDLInput
* Fix Color ( -1, -1, -1, -1 ) issue
* GameStates as a singleton class?
* Fix GameStates "leak" due to vector not destructing until end of app exec
* Perhaps GameState could also implement Load method?
* namespace nom
* Use nullptr instead of NULL
* Try using ( SDL_WaitEvent == true ) wrapped within main.cpp while loop or such
so that we do not prematurely terminate while we may still have events in queue;
this may fix the SDLInput crashes within TTcards
> while ( game.isRunning() && SDL_WaitEvent() != 0 )
> See SDL-- library for idea details

* * +=, ++, etc. overload methods for Sprite class among other potential candidates
  > Coords, Color classes now implement this.

* Wrap SDL_PollEvent ( &event ) within GameStates into SDLInput
  > This is now taken care of elsewhere

* color constants (think: white, black, etc)

* Fix SDL_SetVideoMode memory leak when toggling fullscreen mode
  > This is a known library leak; not likely to be fixed (maybe libSDL v2 does?)

* Use coords class in sprite
* Fix Coords offsets ( -1, -1, -1, -1 ) issue with blitting
* Rename class SDLBitmapFont to SDL_BitmapFont
* GColor::getSDLColor or such that will return to us a SDL_Color struct for use in
SDL_TFont and wherever else
* Use GColor::getColorAsInt everywhere as needed
* Rename GColor to nom::Color
* GameState::Update ( SDL_Surface *video_buffer ) ?
* GameState::Draw ( SDL_Surface *video_buffer ) ?
* rename SDL_TFont && SDL_BitmapFont::setTextBuffer to setText
* rename methods in nomlib/Sprite to lowerCaseCamelStyle
* Clean up Timer class; 1. match Timer & FPS
* msgbox bottom, right border (needs additional depth)
* Cross-platform considerations (think: Makefiles, OS bins & args, etc.)
* Library versioning (think: sonames)
* man install(1), pkg-config(1)
